# Phronima
Phronima is a higher-level language for brainf*ck

# Modes 
There are two modes/subcommands
  - 'com': will compile the source code into brainf*ck code
  - 'sim': will simulate the program created by the source code 

        NOTE: some operations do not currently work in 'compile' mode. Still a work in progress.
